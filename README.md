# The Third Turn

Two working papers on live betting markets, with the code, derived artifacts and governance record
that reproduce them.

- **Paper 1 — *From Pitcher Fatigue to Market Efficiency***: a forecast-encompassing test of public
  information in live baseball wagering markets. (`paper/paper1.md`, `paper/paper1.pdf`)
- **Paper 2 — *What Prices Cannot Tell You***: an identification study of information transmission.
  The pre-registered gate returned **Outcome C — the pricing contrast is not identifiable with this
  class of instrument**, and no estimate of it is reported. (`paper/paper2.md`, `paper/paper2.pdf`)

This repository accompanies the first paper of the same name. It began as an attempt to trade the
pitcher times-through-order penalty and became a study of a harder question: does *any* publicly
observable baseball variable improve on a sharp live betting market's own forecast of remaining
runs? Across 163 Major League Baseball games, none does. The market's forecast error is not
predictable out of sample (R² = −0.037), and the one variable that appears to beat the market, a
starter's velocity decline, turns out to be post-treatment survivorship bias.

The contribution is threefold: an **empirical** map of where public information stops improving a
sharp forecast; a **methodological** one, an escalating validation protocol (the Third Turn
Protocol) that shifts the burden of proof from predicting an outcome to improving on an existing
forecast; and an **infrastructure** one, a released benchmark dataset and the reference code that
reproduces every number and figure in the paper.

## The research program

**Paper 1 asked whether prices contain public information. Paper 2 asks whether prices reveal how
that information entered the market.** Information in prices; formation of prices. The two are
distinct questions, answered with different instruments and different assumptions.

| `*.py` (top level) | The analysis that produces `output/*.json` (encompassing, calibration, transfer function, remaining-runs model, debiasing). |
| `output/` | The **frozen Paper-1 result caches** (`*.json`) that reproduce the paper, plus the **live collection panels** (see Data). |
| `protocol/` | The Third Turn Protocol: the validation ladder, the safeguard registry, and the objective stopping rules. |
| `benchmark/` | The Third Turn Benchmark Dataset docs: schema, reference results, changelog. |
| `ops/` | *(optional reading)* the research-governance registers, the culture of falsification made auditable. |

## Reproduce the paper

Full instructions, with the verification results for each step, are in
[`paper/REPRODUCE.md`](paper/REPRODUCE.md). The short version:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt   # the pinned REPLICATION set
python3 encompass.py                   # -> output/encompass.json
python3 calibration.py                 # -> output/calibration.json
python3 program_a.py                   # -> output/program_a.json
python3 paper/make_figures.py          # Paper 1 figures
python3 paper/make_paper2_figures.py   # Paper 2 figures
python3 paper/build_pdf.py             # -> paper/paper1.pdf   (needs Chromium)
python3 paper/build_pdf.py paper2      # -> paper/paper2.pdf
```

Install from **`requirements-lock.txt`** (exact pins, verified). `requirements.txt` is the live
collector's runtime set — floors only, and it pulls packages replication does not need.

Every number in the paper regenerates deterministically from the committed caches in `output/`; no
live feed access is required. Verified 2026-08-22: the JSON outputs and all figures regenerate
**byte-identically**, and `pytest tests/` reports **113 passed**. PDFs rebuild to identical content
but are not byte-identical (the writer embeds a creation timestamp).

> **Do not run `paper/make_concept_figures.py`.** It is superseded: it rewrites three figures that
> `make_figures.py` already produces, with different images. See `paper/REPRODUCE.md`.

## Data

Two kinds of data ship here, kept separate on purpose:

- **`output/*.json` (frozen Paper-1 caches).** The derived snapshots and results that reproduce the
  paper exactly. This is the reproducibility core.
- **`output/*_panel.jsonl` (live collection).** Timestamped book quotes, game state, and team
  totals collected continuously since the paper's sample, accruing toward the market-microstructure
  follow-on. These are **not** used in Paper 1 (which is frozen on the June-2026 sample); they are
  provided as a growing research asset. See `benchmark/dataset/schema.md` for the field dictionary.

**The raw live-collection panels are NOT included in this repository.** They are third-party
sportsbook quote and HTTP-header observations whose redistribution terms have not been established,
and they are excluded from every public build. Field-level documentation is published in
`benchmark/dataset/panels_schema.md`; the data itself is available to researchers on request,
subject to the originating endpoints' terms. Neither paper's figures require them: Paper 1
reproduces from the frozen `output/*.json` caches, and Paper 2's figures are schematic.

## License

Both grants below are made by the author, over material the author created. Neither extends to
anything obtained from a third party.

- **Code:** MIT (`LICENSE`) — the analysis, collection, figure and build scripts.
- **Manuscripts, figures, the visual companion and documentation:** CC BY 4.0.
- **Author-created aggregate artifacts:** CC BY 4.0. These are named explicitly rather than by
  wildcard: `paper/figdata/fig_market_calibration_agg.json`,
  `paper/figdata/fig_weather_runs_agg.json`, and the summary result files in `output/` that contain
  only counts, coefficients, rates and confidence intervals. None carries a per-observation value.

**No licence is granted over third-party material, and none is redistributed here.** Sportsbook
quoted prices and line trajectories, HTTP delivery and provenance metadata, and MLB Advanced Media
game state and identifiers were obtained from commercial and public endpoints whose own terms govern
their reuse. The Odds API's terms prohibit redistributing its data as downloadable files; MLB
Advanced Media permits only individual, non-commercial, non-bulk use absent written authorization.
Those observations — and every derived file from which an individual quoted line, price, timestamp
or third-party identifier could be reconstructed — are excluded from this repository and from both
grants above. They are not offered on request.

Every figure in the papers regenerates from what is published here. One companion figure
(`supp_line_movement`) is observation-level and ships as a frozen rendered image; its underlying
series is withheld pending written permission from the data provider. No persistent archive or DOI
will be minted over any third-party or unresolved derived data.
