# Live microstructure — running notes

Exploratory notes on the runner-banked live streams. **Standing rule: no substantive conclusion
from one night.** Both candidate findings below dissolved under measurement-process scrutiny; that
is the useful result. Reproduce with `microstructure_probe.py`.

## Data on hand (first night, 2026-07-03 → 07-04, ~23h)

| stream | rows | content |
|---|---|---|
| `book_panel` | 28k | FanDuel + Bovada game totals, change-only, 21 games, **10% live** |
| `team_total_panel` | 2.1k | Pinnacle implied *per-team* run distribution — line, σ, skew, **full pmf** |
| `game_state_panel` | 3k | inning/out/score/base/TTO changes, event matching |
| `ledger` | 3 | legacy ARM fires (refuted rule; informational) |

## Candidate finding 1 — cross-book divergence → DOES NOT SURVIVE

Headline looked strong: FanDuel and Bovada disagree on the total **61%** of the time, mean gap
0.46 runs. The validation checklist deflates it:
- **Convention:** 100% of lines on the 0.5 grid — clean, no push/half-run issue.
- **Tick size:** 66% of disagreements are a single 0.5 tick; only **~20% of all observations** are a
  material (≥1-run) gap. "Disagree 61%" is mostly one-tick rounding.
- **Regime:** 90% of rows are pregame; forward-fill staleness at comparison is a median of ~1 hour
  (stable pregame lines). A 0.5 pregame gap that sits for an hour is ordinary market-making.
- **Live overlap:** **zero** timestamps where *both* books were quoting live simultaneously. There
  is therefore no live cross-book divergence result in this data at all.

Verdict: not a finding yet. The interesting object (live divergence) was never observed, because
the daemon did not capture the two books live at the same moment.

## Candidate finding 2 — cross-book leadership → NOT IDENTIFIABLE (and the lesson is the keeper)

> **Naïve lead-lag estimators are biased under unequal quote frequencies.**

- Naïve "who reaches a new line level first" says FanDuel leads Bovada **73:5**. But FanDuel is
  sampled **3.7× more densely**, so it mechanically arrives first. A gap-closing estimator *flips*
  to Bovada — same confound, opposite sign (its counts track the 3.7× record ratio).
- Density-neutral test (resample both to a 60-s grid, lagged cross-correlation of changes):
  FanDuel-leads r = +0.034 vs Bovada-leads r = +0.023 — both ≈ 0, indistinguishable. **Leadership
  is not identifiable from one night.**

This is the paper's own discipline turned on the microstructure data, and it is worth keeping as a
**future Paper-2 appendix**: *"Naïve lead-lag estimators are biased under unequal quote
frequencies; use equal-cadence resampling or an event study."* The lesson generalizes beyond sport.

## What survives / is promising

- **The implied-distribution panel.** Pinnacle's per-team full pmf every snapshot (implied σ, skew
  banked) is unusual — most datasets carry only line + odds. It is the substrate for
  variance-repricing, skew evolution, uncertainty collapse, and inning-level entropy — plausibly a
  stronger paper than price leadership, and gated by **SR-2** in
  [`protocol/stopping_rules.md`](protocol/stopping_rules.md). (Note: the +0.14 implied skew here is
  the *full-game per-team* distribution, a different object from Paper 1's +1.23 *remaining-runs*
  skew.)

## Root cause of "zero simultaneous live quotes" — FOUND & FIXED (2026-07-04)

Not a coverage gap: **FanDuel returns rows for every live game** (all 15 live-window games; often
more rows than Bovada), but the adapter read the in-play flag off the *event* object
(`ev.get("inPlay")`) where that key does not exist — so **every one of FanDuel's 32,085 rows was
mislabelled `live: false`**, and the two books were never seen live together. The flag actually
lives on the *market* object (`m["inPlay"]`, with `marketStatus` OPEN/SUSPENDED). Fixed in
`sources/fanduel.py` to read `m.get("inPlay")` and also capture `status`. Verified live: a fetch
during 7 in-progress games now returns 7 `live=True` quotes (was 0), including one `SUSPENDED`
market. Takes effect on the runner's next re-arm. This unblocks 2-book simultaneous overlap; the
change is prospective (does not relabel the already-banked rows).

## Daemon priority changes (overlap was the scarce resource — Priority 1 now fixed)

1. **Simultaneous live coverage — code fixed; awaiting production verification.** The fix is
   prospective (next runner re-arm). Priority 1 is complete **by observed behaviour, not elapsed
   time**: the `collection_health.py` *fix-verification* block flips to VERIFIED only once committed
   checkpoints show all of — FanDuel live quotes > 0, simultaneous live pairs > 0, overlap games > 0,
   marketStatus populated, and a non-null median sync lag. *Remaining after that:* SR-1 also requires
   ≥3 books, so a third live book is still needed before leadership analysis (see 4).
2. **Alternate-total strips.** Serves *both* papers (implied CDF → implied mean for the Paper 1
   de-vig appendix; distribution calibration for Paper 2). **Not** in the `customPageId=mlb`
   payload — only the main `TOTAL_POINTS_(OVER/UNDER)` (one per game) is there; alt totals require a
   per-event detail endpoint (a separate call per game). Next concrete step.
3. **Quote lifecycle.** Partly started: `status` (OPEN/SUSPENDED) is now captured on each FanDuel
   row. Still want age / time-since-update / resume timestamps.
4. **Additional books.** A third book that *overlaps live* — required for SR-1's ≥3-book criterion
   and to turn "who leads" into a network question. Useful only if it quotes live concurrently.

## Paper 2 reframing

Not "find inefficiencies" but **"how does information propagate through partially synchronized
forecasting systems?"** Sportsbooks are the observable laboratory; the transferable question is a
forecasting one. Same evidentiary standard as Paper 1.

## Stopping rule

The leadership gate is now canonical as **SR-1** in [`protocol/stopping_rules.md`](protocol/stopping_rules.md)
(≥2,000 simultaneous live quote pairs, ≥100 overlap games, median sync lag <15 s, ≥3 live books).
`microstructure_probe.py` prints its live status each run — tonight all four FAIL. The lead-lag and
divergence lessons are catalogued as safeguards **S-10** and **S-11** in
[`protocol/safeguards.md`](protocol/safeguards.md), with their failures logged in
[`decisions/RESEARCH_DECISIONS_LOG.md`](decisions/RESEARCH_DECISIONS_LOG.md).
