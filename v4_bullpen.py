"""V4 analysis — does a gassed bullpen amplify the velocity-cliff scoring window?

Historical preview (we bet nothing yet — no live team-total lines): join the trailing-
3-day bullpen workload to the game features and ask two things about the RELEVANT pen —
the OPPOSING team's, since that's who pitches to the team we care about:

  A. Baseline — do facing-team runs rise with the opposing pen's recent workload?
  B. The multiplier — among games where a Mid/Back starter is chased early (the TTO
     cliff fires), does the facing team score MORE when the pen behind him is already
     gassed vs rested? That interaction is the whole V4 thesis.

Facing-team runs stand in for the (not-yet-captured) team total. Small cells — CIs/counts
shown, thresholds picked by the data.
